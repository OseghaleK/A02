Git tutorial- Create a new project, or repository, on a Git hosting platform. Once established, clone this repository onto your local machine. Add a file to your local repository, committing changes to save them. Push these changes to the main branch. If modifications occur in the online repository, pull those changes to your local machine. For versioning, create a branch, make changes, and commit them. Propose alterations to the main branch by initiating a pull request. Upon approval, merge your branch into the main branch.
Github tutorial- Begin by setting up a local Git repository. Introduce new files, stage changes, and commit them with descriptive messages. Create and push branches to GitHub. Propose modifications through pull requests, and merge them into the main branch upon approval. To keep your local copy up-to-date, fetch changes made online back to your computer
Webstrom tutorial- Start using WebStorm for your project by opening, checking out, or creating a project. Familiarize yourself with the user interface, and efficiently navigate through your project. Search for symbols, explore code, and easily find usages. Navigate to symbol declarations and move through the code timeline seamlessly. Complete coding tasks, inspect and fix issues on the fly, and utilize WebStorm for efficient code refactoring. Run and debug your applications within WebStorm, following code style standards and keeping your source code under version control. Customize your WebStorm environment for an optimal coding experience.


Branch: A separate line of development that diverges from the main code base. Branches allow multiple developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.
Clone: To create an identical copy of a repository, including all of its files and version history, onto a local machine.
Commit: To save changes to a file or set of files in a repository. Each commit creates a new version of the code, which is tracked and can be reverted to if necessary.
Fetch: To download changes from a remote repository and update the local copy without merging the changes.
Git: An open-source version control system used for tracking changes in code over time.
GitHub: A web-based hosting service for Git repositories that allows for collaboration and sharing of code with others.
Merge: To combine changes from one branch into another. Merging allows for the integration of divergent code changes into a single codebase.
Merge Conflict: A situation that occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from one branch into another. This typically happens when two or more branches have made changes to the same file in conflicting ways.
Push: To upload local changes to a remote repository and update the repository's version history.
Pull: To download changes from a remote repository and update the local copy, merging the changes into the current branch.
Remote: A version of the repository hosted on a server, which can be accessed by developers for collaboration and sharing of code.
Repository: A directory or storage space where code is stored and managed using version control. It can contain multiple files and folders, along with the version history of each file.
